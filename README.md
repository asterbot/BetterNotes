For a detailed walk-through of the app, please see [User documentation](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/as5sodhi/cs-346-project/-/wikis/User-Guide)

## Getting Started
Find our latest release and install the executable for your Operating System.

To run the project locally from source, you will need a [.env](https://uofwaterloo-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/as5sodhi_uwaterloo_ca/Documents/CS346%20execs/.env?csf=1&web=1&e=yBzsIH) file.
 Place the file in the desktop folder in the root, and the project should be able to run.
- The file may get downloaded with the name `env`, not `.env`, so please rename it appropriately if it gets downloaded with the wrong name.

> PS: If the link to download the .env file does not work, please email as5sodhi@uwaterloo.ca.

The executables have the connection string encoded in them, so the .env file is only required if you are building from source! To build from source using IntelliJ, please run it from the desktop folder!

You may log in with the following account which has been created, or you can create your own!
