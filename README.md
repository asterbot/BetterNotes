## Project Description
BetterNotes is a note-taking platform designed for students in math and computer science courses who take notes virtually. 
It supports a wide range of content formats—including Markdown, code blocks, math equations, media, graphs, and free-form 
canvases—making it easy to capture complex ideas. 
To help students stay organized, BetterNotes presents their notes in a structured, 
mind map–like view that reflects the flow and hierarchy of their thoughts.


## Video/Screenshots
